# LiveDebug

LiveDebug is a programming livestream focusing primarily on debugging random problems that haven't been looked at before by the streamer.    The intent is to explore the
approaches to debugging that are common everyday and to expose the exploration,
deadends, and successes that come with debug.  Most streams are archived on
[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeiO6Wx8hMZfxG1gOsh7Lyg?feature=applinks).

Secondarily, LiveDebug is also a testbed for structured debugging.  Through the
stream, hypothesis, analysis and log of things that have been noted in the debug
exercise are captured in a structured form.  This is an evolving template in and is available [here](template/index.md).

The main (only) streamer, [Matthew](https://linkedin.com/matthewtippett), is an Engineering Manager in Silicon Valley.  Geek and nerd by nature, AmA about anything.  If you would like to stream under the LiveDebug Team, reach out to matthew@livedebug.dev to get online.

# Bugs we've explored
Apart from other random hackery that may occur on the stream, the focused effort
is captured below. The streams are archived onto youtube and are linked where
possible in the daily log on each bug page.
